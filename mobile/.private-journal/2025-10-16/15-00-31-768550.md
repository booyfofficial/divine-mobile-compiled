## Project Notes

OpenVine profile video loading:

File: `lib/providers/profile_videos_provider.dart`
- Lines 322-324: Removed 3-second timeout that was causing early completion
- Lines 486-487: Removed timeout from loadMore as well for consistency

The fix ensures videos load automatically when opening a profile, without needing to hit the manual refresh button.

Related files:
- `lib/screens/profile_screen_scrollable.dart:134` - calls `_loadProfileVideos()` automatically on init
- This was working correctly but the provider timeout was preventing videos from loading

Test failures pre-existing:
- 19 mock-related errors about `hashtagVideos` field/method conflict
- Not related to my changes - these are existing issues with mock generation
