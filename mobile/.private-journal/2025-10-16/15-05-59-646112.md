## Project Notes

Profile video loading fix - iteration 2:

**Problem 1**: Original 3-second timeout completed too early, showing 0 videos on first load
**Solution 1**: Removed timeout entirely to wait for EOSE
**Problem 2**: No timeout caused infinite hang if EOSE never fired
**Solution 2**: Added 30-second safety timeout

Files modified:
- `lib/providers/profile_videos_provider.dart:322-346` - Added 30s timeout to initial load
- `lib/providers/profile_videos_provider.dart:508-530` - Added 30s timeout to loadMore

The timeout includes:
- Warning log when it fires (helps debug relay issues)
- Completion with whatever videos were received (better than hanging)
- Error handling in case something throws during timeout

This is the proper async pattern: wait for the right signal, but have a safety timeout.
