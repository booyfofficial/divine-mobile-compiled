## Project Notes

# OpenVine Encryption Export Compliance - Completed

## What I Did
Generated comprehensive encryption export compliance documentation for Apple App Store and France export requirements.

## Key Findings

1. **Info.plist Already Correct**: The `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` key is already set to `false` in `ios/Runner/Info.plist` (lines 33-34). This is the CORRECT setting.

2. **App DOES Use Encryption**: But all encryption is either:
   - EXEMPT (HTTPS/TLS, iOS Keychain)
   - STANDARD algorithms (secp256k1, ChaCha20, AES, RSA)

3. **No Proprietary Crypto**: All algorithms are from international standards bodies:
   - IETF: ChaCha20-Poly1305, TLS, HKDF
   - NIST: AES, SHA-256
   - SECG: secp256k1

## Encryption in OpenVine

### Nostr Protocol (Primary)
- **secp256k1** elliptic curve for keys, signatures, key exchange
- **NIP-44**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encrypted DMs
- **NIP-04**: AES-256-CBC (legacy, deprecated)
- **NIP-59**: Gift wrapping with ephemeral keys

### ProofMode
- **RSA-2048** + **SHA-256** for video attestation
- **PGP/OpenPGP** signatures (dart_pg, openpgp packages)

### Storage
- **iOS Keychain** for private key storage (OS-provided, exempt)

## Documents Created

1. **ENCRYPTION_EXPORT_COMPLIANCE.md**: 
   - Comprehensive technical documentation
   - All algorithms listed with standards references
   - Export control classification (likely ECCN 5D992.c)
   - U.S., EU, and France compliance guidance

2. **APP_STORE_ENCRYPTION_SUMMARY.md**:
   - Quick reference for App Store submission
   - TestFlight compliance questions and answers
   - Common issues and solutions
   - When to contact authorities

## Important for Future Submissions

- **TestFlight uploads**: May show "Missing Compliance" - just answer questions honestly
- **Exempt encryption answer**: YES (all standard algorithms)
- **Annual BIS report**: May be required if U.S. entity (February 1st deadline)
- **France/ANSSI**: Generally exempt but may require notification

## Info.plist Status
✅ **NO CHANGES NEEDED** - Already correctly configured with `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false`

This is correct because the app uses only exempt/standard encryption.
