## Project Notes

Search is completely broken in two ways:
1. Local filtering: FIXED by accessing videoEventService.discoveryVideos directly
2. Remote NIP-50: NOT IMPLEMENTED - need to add search: parameter to filter

The remote search was returning 0 results because we were just re-filtering the same 157 cached local events client-side. No actual network search happening!

Next steps:
- Check if nostr_sdk supports Filter.search parameter
- Test if relay.divine.video supports NIP-50
- Implement proper NIP-50 in NostrService.searchVideos()
