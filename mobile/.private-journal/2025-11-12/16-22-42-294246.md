## Project Notes

Phase 1 of NIP-50 complete: Local cache search now works!

**Testing Needed**:
1. Search for "king" - should filter local cache to only relevant videos
2. Search for "doorasdfasdf" - should return 0 results (not 50 random videos!)
3. Search for known hashtag like "funny" - should find videos with that tag

**Still TODO**:
- Make embedded relay forward search to external relays
- Add "Search external relays" button for when local results are insufficient
- Handle "no results" case gracefully

Files modified:
- `flutter_embedded_nostr_relay/lib/src/models/filter.dart` - Added unknownFields getter
- `flutter_embedded_nostr_relay/lib/src/storage/event_store.dart` - Added NIP-50 SQL search
